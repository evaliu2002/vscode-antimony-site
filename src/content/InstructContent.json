    "text": "Antimony is a human-readable, human-writable modular model definition language. The Antimony modeling language provides a way to construct human readable models for Systems Biology that can be exported into the SBML community format. As models become more complex, it is desirable to have a model development environment that understands the syntax and semantics of the modeling language so as to reduce the amount of typing and to provide early detection of syntax errors and inconsistencies. Such capabilities are widely used in software development environments such as Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code. For example, when writing Python source code, VSCode provides linting (static code analysis), code navigation, refactoring, and more. We are unaware of tools that provide similar capabilities for the development of SBML models. Vscode-antimony provides “smart editor” features for building Antimony models. The tool is implemented as a language support library in Visual Studio Code. Vscode-antimony provides syntax recognition, highlights, hover messages for displaying information (e.g., display name, annotation link, initialized value), code navigation for locating the line of declaration, and convenient annotations with commonly used knowledge sources (e.g., ChEBI and UniProt). In addition, there is support for detecting errors and likely errors (warnings). For example, vscode-antimony displays an error when the user tries to call a function that has not been declared (most likely from a typographical error), and a warning is displayed if there is no initialization of a declared species. Further, vscode-antimony makes it convenient to work simultaneously with the Antimony and the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) representations of models by providing a split-screen editing capability with synchronization between the representations.",
