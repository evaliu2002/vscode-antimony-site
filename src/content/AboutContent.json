  "title": "Why Vscode-Antimony?",
  "text": "Antimony is a human-readable, human-writable modular model definition language; the language provides a way to construct human readable models for Systems Biology that can be exported into the SBML community format. As models become more complex, it is desirable to have a model development environment that understands the syntax and semantics of the modeling language so as to reduce the amount of typing and to provide early detection of syntax errors and inconsistencies. Vscode-antimony is implemented as a language support library in Visual Studio Code. Vscode-antimony provides syntax recognition, hover messages for displaying information (e.g., display name, annotation link, initialized value), code navigation for locating the line of declaration, and convenient annotations with commonly used knowledge sources (e.g., ChEBI and UniProt). In addition, there is support for detecting errors and likely errors (warnings). Vscode-antimony makes it convenient to work simultaneously with the Antimony and the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) representations of models.",
